# Telecom Churn Prediction (Logistic Regression)

## 📌 Overview
Beginner-level machine learning project to predict customer churn in a telecom company using **Logistic Regression**.  
This was a guided project, partially implemented by me with mentorship from ChatGPT, as part of my self-learning journey in supervised ML.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the telecom service) based on service usage data and customer details.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Algorithm Used
- **Logistic Regression**  
A binary classification model used to classify churn (`1`) vs no churn (`0`).

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- Data Visualizations using Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
- [telecom_churn.csv](./telecom_churn.csv) — included in this repository  
The dataset contains customer demographics, service details, and churn labels.

## 📝 Notes
This project was completed with partial self-effort and partial support from ChatGPT.  
It helped me understand data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Status
✅ Completed as a learning-phase project  
🔜 Will try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost) in future versions
